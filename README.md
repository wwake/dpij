I've [Bill Wake] updated the code to work with JDK 1.8 and JUnit 4.13. This eliminated the need for references to TestCase, and let tests use assertThrows().

The original code from the book is in OozinozDpij-original.zip; the current code is updated to use generics etc. 

Thanks to Juan Manuel Gimeno for making those changes:
* Added an interface com.oozinoz.iterator.AcycliclyIterable to allow generic iterator code.
* Used foreach rather than for/while loops.
* Corrected some javadoc problems.
* Changed StringBuffers to StringBuilders and Hashtables to HashMaps. 
* Changed the locale to ENGLISH to get tests to pass regardless of local locale.
